Exception:
*login screen is perfect, no changes is needed.*

Global:
*Ensure all logo design uses for all pages/screens C:\Users\justi\OneDrive\Desktop\FoodBeGood\assets\icons\"Screenshot 2026-02-10 161900.png" directly, adjust the size accordingly*
*Ensure All system back touchscreen for all pages/screens have double click protection to prompt for quitting the app to prevent accidentally clicked. *
*The dashboard cards are lifeless, I would like the design to stay the same but breath life into them, having animations and perhaps more vibrant with different gradient or shades of green. Of course with consideration of dark/light mode, ALso, the words should be bold and have darker tone*
*light mode : Using a split of lighter tone of green and white for the background, dark mode: using a split of darker green and a slightly darker green , making sure all words are visible in both modes*


Student Dashboard : 
1) Should show what date , day and time.
2) Good morning/afternoon/evening (greetings) should be based on daytime changes.
3) Each dashboard cards should have pop-up effect, AND require subtle animation (for example the chart/graphs should be moving, the time remaining should be counting down wih color coded, the flame streaks should also be moving as well, the social impact card - heart icon should be beating and background color should be a darker green tone).
4) it should be "12.3" Avg meal/Month not just Avg/Month 
5) when user touch screen, it will give hint that if swiped to the left, you can access QR code (like flipping a book while hinting what the next page is about)

Pick up my meal:
1) I don't need the bar above the "confirm pickup" to tell me what i picked because the container above already told me what i picked.
2) Consider each items will contain a food image file so we need to cater for the eventual image files added.
3) Allow user to unselect by touching the food / items selected.
4) Give perhaps three categories : Food/beverages/Deserts --> rather than choosing the food by scrolling top to bottom, i would like horizontal search (scroll left to right) . With food filters . Giving a food shopping / ordering vibes.
5) when clicked back button, it should warn that the food collection will be lost.

Workflow changed:
User clicked pick up my meal, select the food to pickup, then able to choose a time slot on a calender to pick the time when the user wanted to pickup, then the dashboard Next Pickup will reflect this change and counting down the time difference. (days hour minute) , when the time to pickup is near (the color code for the pickup card on dashboard changes), the app will send a notification through the bell icon and also send out app notifications given user permission for pickup reminder. During pickup, user will show canteen the QR code, which can also be accessed conveniently by swiping to the left on the student dashboard.
